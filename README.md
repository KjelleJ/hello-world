# hello-world
Hi there!

Some years ago I developed a set of Android apps and added them to Google Play. I have not updated the apps according to the requirements of Google so the apps have been removed from Google Play. I have now put the source code of the two most popular apps "Solarone" and "Where Am I" on GitHub. The apps had good scores (4+) but the number of downloads were just a number of thousands for each app.

Hopefully someone wants to download the source code and continue the work. You must adapt to a newer Android version, put the code into Android Studio etc.
